## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Add a file to the git repo. You must do this before you can commit anything.

#### branch
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Branch is like a tree. If you have two ideas of where you want your code to go, you could branch your code
and try out the different directions.

#### checkout
<!-- Your defnition here -->

<!-- Your defnition here -->
Clone is the version of your files that live offline on your computer. You should sync these with your computer when you have internet access.

#### commit
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Save your latest changes with a comment. If you ever need to, you can go back in time to view these saves.

#### fetch

Fetching is when you look back at your recent commit, but don't merge the commit with your current version.

#### log
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### merge
<!-- Your defnition here -->
You merge two forks or branches when you apply the changes in one to the other, making them identical.
